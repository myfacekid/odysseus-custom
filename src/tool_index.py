Todos: title in text/title, optional details, horizon focus/build/aim/misc, priority critical/elevated/steady. focus/build REQUIRE parent_ids (list parent horizon first: focus→build, build→aim).

    "serve_preset": "Launch a saved Cookbook serve preset by name. Reuses the exact tmux command + host the user already saved. Use for 'run stable diffusion 3.5', 'serve vllm-qwen', 'start the inpaint model' — preset-name matches the user's UI labels.",

Use when the user (or a previous turn) launched something via ssh+tmux and now wants it visible in the UI, stoppable via stop_served_model, and usable in the model picker.",
    "list_cookbook_servers": "List the cookbook's configured servers (remote GPU boxes + local) and which is the current default. Use this BEFORE download_model/serve_model when the user didn't name a host — to decide where to run, or to ask the user which server when ambiguous. Downloads/serves default to the cookbook's selected server, NOT localhost.",
    "app_api": "Generic loopback to ANY Nobody internal endpoint. Use this when the user wants something the UI can do but there's no named tool for it. Covers calendar, gallery, memory, notes, tasks, settings, research, compare, cookbook GPUs/state — every UI button hits some /api/* endpoint and you can hit it too. action='endpoints' with filter=<keyword> lists available endpoints. action='call' takes method+path+body. Hits same routes the UI uses — auth flows free. NOTE: themes are NOT an API endpoint — use the ui_control tool (create_theme / set_theme), not app_api. SESSIONS/CHATS: do NOT use app_api for these — GET /api/sessions returns EMPTY for tool calls (it's owner-filtered and tool calls authenticate as a different identity). To list/rename/archive/delete/fork chats use the list_sessions and manage_session tools instead. DOCUMENTS/LIBRARY: do NOT use app_api — there is no register-from-disk endpoint. Create Library docs with create_document (returns graph_node_id), list/read via manage_documents, and link them with search_knowledge suggest_link / merge_subgraph.",
